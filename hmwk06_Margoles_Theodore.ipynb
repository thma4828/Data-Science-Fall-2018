    "This assignment is due on Moodle by **5 PM on Friday November 30**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**. \n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

    "[Usain O'Flaherty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVeLz0FIj9A), the famous octopus athlete of the distinguished O'Flaherty family, has been keeping careful track of how much ice cream he eats after his training runs. He has stored the data in `icecream.csv`, where his ice cream consumption is measured in number of scoops, and his run distances are saved in units of miles. In this exercise you will construct a simple linear regression model for the response variable \"amount of ice cream consumed\" (`scoops`), using \"number of miles run\" (`miles`) as the feature. Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame."

The drawback is that at some point a human being can only eat so much ice cream and so in reality the increase in scoops eaten will start to taper off to a constant amount being something like how much ice cream the human stomach can even fit at any one 24 hour period, and eventially the linear correlation will no longer be informative, that is our prediction will overshoot the results if he for instance ran a ultramarathon of 240 miles; it is not likely that he would eat 102 scoops of ice cream!!!"
